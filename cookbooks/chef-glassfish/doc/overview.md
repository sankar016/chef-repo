[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/realityforge/chef-glassfish.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/realityforge/chef-glassfish)

The glassfish cookbook installs and configures the GlassFish application server and the OpenMQ message broker bundled
with the GlassFish application server. The cookbook also defines resources to create and configure GlassFish
application domains and OpenMQ broker instances.

A sample project with a Vagrantfile that launches a glassfish instance is available in [chef-glassfish-example](https://github.com/realityforge/chef-glassfish-example) project.
